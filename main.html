            philosphy is the curiosity of human being is about asking question the reason why i call kids as the best of philosophers is that they are not used to the world.
            they keep looking asking and exploring the world and they keep amazed.

            as a person who has work with artificial intelligence i know that how to make a robot immitates humans behavior but the thing is there is a big diffrence between ai and human intelligence. but as a human being who loves philosophy i wonder what is the real diffrence between what im coding and what human really is <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            once an ai learns something he will never be able to do the thing that he considers it wrong the point is in the world the only being which is capable of doing the wrong thing is us humans.
            thats why the nearest ai that we have built is Reinforcment learning which inside it we have put a random fuction which makes it do the wrong choice with a certain probabbility;
            i think we humans make mistakes by not just random event by a feelling that i call it guts.
